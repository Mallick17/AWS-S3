# Bucket
## Objects
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. You can use [Amazon S3 inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/s3/inventory)  to get a list of all objects in your bucket. For others to access your objects, youâ€™ll need to explicitly grant them permissions. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/s3/object-properties)
