# S3 Encryption Types
### **1. SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys)**  
- **Overview:**  
S3 automatically encrypts data using **AES-256** encryption before saving it to the disk and decrypts it when accessed. The encryption keys are managed by AWS, and users do not need to handle them.

- **How It Works:**  
  - When an object is uploaded, S3 automatically encrypts it using an encryption key generated and managed by Amazon S3.
  - When the object is retrieved, S3 decrypts it automatically.

- **Key Management:**  
  - Amazon S3 manages the encryption keys internally.
  - No additional configuration is required.

- **Use Case:**  
  - Suitable for users who need basic encryption without managing keys.

- **Limitations:**  
  - Users do not have control over encryption keys.
  - No fine-grained access control over key usage.

  <summary>Steps to Create</summary>
  
**Steps**:  
1. **For Existing Buckets**:  
   - Go to **S3 > Bucket > Properties > Default Encryption > Edit**.  
   - Select **SSE-S3** (Amazon S3-managed keys).  
2. **For New Buckets**:  
   - During bucket creation, under **Default Encryption**, select **SSE-S3**.  

**Example**:  
- The user navigates to the bucket properties, clicks **Edit** under **Default Encryption**, and selects **SSE-S3** to enable encryption for an existing bucket.  

</details>

**Key Points**:  
- No need to create or manage keys.  
- AWS handles key rotation and security.  
- Suitable for general use cases where key management is not a concern.  


### **2. SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service)**   
- **Overview:**  
S3 encrypts objects using **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**, allowing more control over encryption keys, including key rotation and access management.

- **How It Works:**  
  - When an object is uploaded, S3 encrypts it using a customer-managed KMS key.
  - The key is stored in AWS KMS and requires permissions to use.
  - AWS KMS logs all key usage in **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing.

- **Key Management:**  
  - Users can choose an **AWS-managed KMS key (default)** or a **customer-managed KMS key (CMK)**.
  - Allows fine-grained access control with **IAM policies** and **key policies**.
  - Supports key rotation.

- **Use Case:**  
  - Suitable for organizations that need better security control and audit logging.
  - Required for compliance with security policies.

- **Limitations:**  
  - Additional cost for AWS KMS key usage.
  - More complex than SSE-S3 due to key permissions.  

<details>
  <summary>Steps to Create</summary>

**Steps**:  
1. **Create a KMS Key**:  
   - Go to **AWS KMS > Create Key**.  
   - Define key type (symmetric/asymmetric), usage (encrypt/decrypt), and permissions.  
2. **Enable SSE-KMS for Existing Buckets**:  
   - Go to **S3 > Bucket > Properties > Default Encryption > Edit**.  
   - Select **SSE-KMS** and choose your KMS key from the dropdown.  
3. **Enable SSE-KMS for New Buckets**:  
   - During bucket creation, under **Default Encryption**, select **SSE-KMS** and specify your KMS key.  

**Example**:  
- The user selects **SSE-KMS** in the bucket properties and chooses an existing KMS key. If no key exists, they can create a new one directly from the S3 console.  

</details>

**Key Points**:  
- You control key creation, rotation, and access.  
- Provides audit logs via CloudTrail for compliance.  
- Suitable for sensitive data and regulatory requirements.

#### **Comparison: SSE-S3 vs. SSE-KMS**  
| Feature                | SSE-S3                          | SSE-KMS                          |  
|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| **Key Management**     | AWS manages keys automatically. | You create and manage keys.      |  
| **Control**            | Limited control over keys.      | Full control over keys.          |  
| **Audit Logs**         | No audit logs for key usage.    | Detailed logs via CloudTrail.    |  
| **Use Case**           | General-purpose encryption.     | Sensitive data and compliance.   |  
| **Ease of Use**        | Simple, no setup required.      | Requires key creation and setup. |

#### **Humanized Analogy**  
- **SSE-S3**: Like a hotel safe where the hotel staff holds the master key. You trust them to keep your valuables secure.  
- **SSE-KMS**: Like a personal safe in your home. You hold the key and decide who else can access it.  

### **3.DSSE-KMS (Dual-Layer Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS)**
- **Overview:**  
AWS provides an additional security layer with **dual-layer encryption**, where each object is encrypted **twice using two different KMS keys**.

- **How It Works:**  
  - The first layer of encryption is applied using an AWS KMS key.
  - A second layer of encryption is applied using a separate KMS key.
  - The decryption process reverses these two encryption layers.

- **Key Management:**  
  - Both encryption layers use AWS KMS.
  - Users can define their own KMS keys for each layer.

- **Use Case:**  
  - Required for compliance with regulatory frameworks like **US government security standards**.
  - Suitable for high-security environments needing multiple layers of encryption.

- **Limitations:**  
  - Higher cost due to the use of two KMS keys.
  - Slightly increased processing overhead.

### **Summary Table:**

| Encryption Type | Key Management | Security Level | Cost | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|------|---------|
| **SSE-S3** | Managed by S3 | Basic | No additional cost | General encryption without key management |
| **SSE-KMS** | Managed by AWS KMS | High | AWS KMS cost applies | Compliance, logging, fine-grained access control |
| **DSSE-KMS** | Two AWS KMS keys | Highest | Higher cost due to dual encryption | High-security environments, government compliance |

1. Navigate to **AWS KMS**.
2. Click **Create key**.
3. Select **Symmetric key** and click **Next**.
4. Define a **Key alias** and add key administrators.
5. Click **Create key**.
6. Copy the **Key ARN** and paste it into the S3 bucketâ€™s encryption settings.

---

## 3. In-Transit Encryption (HTTPS Enforcement)

### **Concept**
In-transit encryption ensures that data transferred between clients and S3 is encrypted using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

### **Enforcing HTTPS in S3 Bucket Policy**
1. Go to the **AWS S3 Dashboard**.
2. Select your bucket and navigate to **Permissions**.
3. Click **Edit** under **Bucket policy**.
4. Add the following policy:
   ```json
   {
       "Id": "EnforceHTTPS",
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "DenyHTTP",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
               "Condition": {
                   "Bool": {
                       "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**.
6. Now, objects can only be accessed using HTTPS.
