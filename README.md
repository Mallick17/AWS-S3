  - Medical images
  - News media archives
- **Key Features**:
  - Millisecond retrieval
  - 68% cheaper than S3 Standard-IA
- **Example**: Storing medical imaging data that is rarely accessed but needs to be retrieved instantly when required.

---

### **b. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (GLACIER)**
- **Description**: Low-cost storage for data that is rarely accessed and can be retrieved in minutes to hours.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Long-term data retention
- **Key Features**:
  - Retrieval options: Expedited (1-5 minutes), Standard (3-5 hours), Bulk (5-12 hours)
  - 10% cheaper than S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- **Example**: Storing yearly financial records for compliance purposes.

---

### **c. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (DEEP_ARCHIVE)**
- **Description**: The lowest-cost storage class for long-term retention of data that is rarely accessed.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Digital preservation
- **Key Features**:
  - Retrieval time: 12-48 hours
  - 95% cheaper than S3 Standard-IA
- **Example**: Storing legal documents that need to be retained for 10+ years but are rarely accessed.

---

## **5. Storage Class for Amazon S3 on Outposts**

### **S3 Outposts (OUTPOSTS)**
- **Description**: Designed for on-premises data storage using AWS Outposts.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Local data processing
  - Data residency requirements
- **Key Features**:
  - Data stored on-premises
  - Compatible with S3 APIs
- **Example**: Storing sensitive data on-premises for compliance with local data residency laws.

---

## **6. Key Considerations When Choosing a Storage Class**

### **a. Access Patterns**
- **Frequent Access**: Use S3 Standard or S3 Express One Zone.
- **Infrequent Access**: Use S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA.
- **Rarely Accessed**: Use S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

### **b. Durability and Availability**
- **High Durability**: All storage classes except S3 One Zone-IA offer 99.999999999% durability.
- **High Availability**: S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA offer 99.99% availability.

### **c. Cost**
- **Frequent Access**: S3 Standard is cost-effective for frequently accessed data.
- **Infrequent Access**: S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA offer lower storage costs but have retrieval fees.
- **Rarely Accessed**: S3 Glacier storage classes offer the lowest storage costs but have retrieval fees and longer retrieval times.
